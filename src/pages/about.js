      <p>
        Hello, my name is Guilherme Teixeira. I'm a software developer, and a
        linguistics undergraduate student based in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love computers and inline-skating since the childhood; and I love to
        read about linguistics and science in general. I love to read science
        fiction, and fantasy literature too. I also enjoy watching NBA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently improving my JavaScript and React skills in my job as a
        front-end developer. In the college, my main goal is to develop research
        on Generative Grammar (aka Chomskyan Syntax) and Language Acquisition.
