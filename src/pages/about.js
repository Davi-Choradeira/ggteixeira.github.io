      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h2> Backstory </h2>
      <p>
        I've made my first steps into programming back in 2007, when I learned
        to build first websites using HTML and CSS. But it was only in 2016 when
        I decided to study nonstop until I could call myself a programmer. I
        started learning Python, R, and Prolog in the college. Less than one
        year later, I was already doing undergraduate research on Natural
        Language Processing and Machine Learning, using mainly Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        One year later, instead of search for jobs within my main area of
        expertise (i.e. Linguistics), I took the harder path and got my first
        job as a developer: a Python Software Development Internship, more than
        200km away from my college, in a financial market company named Vert
        Capital.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent one year working and living in São Paulo city. I worked with
        amazing devs, learned a lot of new things — both code-related and
        industry-related —, met the amazing dev community in there, attended to
        talks, courses, conferences, and more. Some of them you can checkout
        here{" "}
        <a

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          in my public personal notes' repository.
        </a>{" "}
        After that long year, I decided that it was the time to move back to São
        Carlos in order to finish my degree, and take the next important step in
        my career: to become a junior developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        After sending 30 CVs and being interviewed by 18 companies in three
        different cities, I received job offers from three of them. Decent
        ratio.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The first job, Junior Python Developer in a company that was offering
          less than my monthly expenses at the time;
        </li>
        <li>
          the second, a decent-paying Fullstack React/Python job in a company
          needing a Python developer with both front-end and linguistics
          background. It was the perfect role for me. I accepted the offer with
          no time;
        </li>
        <li>But the third was a job as a Computational Linguist intern. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Even though I already knew that I wanted to work with code, I had to
        make a strategic decision: Linguist jobs are rare, and that one was a
        once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that was being given to me, to not only
        work with the subject I studied fiercely for years, but to work
        alongside some of the best computational linguists out there. So I
        changed my mind in the last minute, and decided that I should postpone
        my career as a developer for exactly one year. No less, no more. And so
        it went.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can talk for hours about how Linguistics is one of the most
        interesting and intriguing sciences we've ever created, I can assure
        you. But let me be honest, that year taught me that I was 100% right
        when I decided to switch from a theoretical linguist to a dev, because
        that job simply wasn't for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lesson learned, it was time to become a software engineer for good. The
        wait didn't take long, fortunately. In August 2020, after completing 1
        year at Redação Nota 1000, I joined Printi as a Junior Front-End
        Developer. I work there since then.
      </p>

      <p>
        Printi is one of the biggest online printing companies in Latin America.
        We dozens of talented people working from three different continents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every day they give me the opportunity to improve my knowledge about
        front-end, and software engineering in general, as well as my english
        skills, teamwork, leadership, organisation, productivity,
        decision-making, autonomy, and much, much more.

      <h3>Nerdy/geeky facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When I was a kid I was capable of read/write/pronounce words — and
          even sentences — backwards. Such an useless skill.
        </li>
        <li>
          When I was a kid, my favorite books used to be the Listel's Phone
          Directory, the Brazilian Portuguese dictionary, and the
          English-Portuguese dictionary

          I've been an Android user from 2010 to 2020, when I switched to iOS. I
          used custom ROMs in all of them. The iPhone turned me into a person
          who pays less attention to and spends less time with the smartphone,
          which was the main goal. It's been a relief since then.
        </li>

          {" "}
          I'm always craving for ways to improve both my productivity and my
          privacy/security, and that influences all the choices I make when it
          comes to the software and hardware I use{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          Even though I love to read, currently I stick to articles and papers
          instead of books most of the time. That started to happen after I
          joined the college. It seems like it's a common for undergraduate
          students to lose their interest — or simply their habit — or reading
          books.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Usually I don't watch movies and TV series, except when my girlfriend
          insists
        </li>
        <li>
          I love writing just for the pleasure of it. I have tons of unfinished
          random essays, articles, the british writer texts, poems. Some of them
          are already published, some are going to be when I finish building my
          Digital Garden
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm not much into literature, but my favorite writers are:

            <li>João Guimarães Rosa (favorite brazilian writer)</li>
            <li>Fernando Pessoa (favorite poet)</li>

          {" "}
          The COVID pandemics messed up with everyone's plans, including mine.
          My current status is 99% linguist because the only thing left for me
          to accomplish within college is to finish writing the final paper
          required to obtain my degree{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          As a college student, my topics of interest are theoretical
          linguistics, mainly Generative Syntax, Formal Semantics, Epistemology,
          Analytic Philosophy, and Language Acquisition{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
