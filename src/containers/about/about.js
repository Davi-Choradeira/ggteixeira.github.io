        Hello, my name is Guilherme Teixeira. I'm a{" "}
        <strong>software developer</strong>, and a
        <strong> linguistics undergraduate student</strong> based in SÃ£o Carlos,
        Brazil.

      <p>
        I love computers, music, inline-skating, and basketball since I was a
        kid; and I love to read about <strong>linguistics</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>science</strong>. I love to read science fiction, and fantasy
        literature too. I also enjoy watching NBA.
      </p>

        I'm currently improving my <strong>JavaScript</strong> and
        <strong> ReactJS </strong> skills at my job as a{" "}
        <strong>front-end developer</strong>. In the college, my main goal is to
        develop research on <strong>Generative Grammar</strong> (aka Chomskyan
        Syntax) and
        <strong> Language Acquisition</strong>.
