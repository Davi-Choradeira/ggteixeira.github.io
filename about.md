## A quick bio

Hello, my name is Guilherme Teixeira. I'm a beginner-level developer, and a linguistics undergraduate student based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. 

I love computers, inline-skating, and I love to read about linguistics and science in general, science fiction, and fantasy literature. I also enjoy watching NBA on TV in the spare time.

I'm currently learning Python (and Django) and JavaScript (and Vue.js) too. I'm also studying NLP (Natural Language Processing) in the college. I hope to know a bit more about Machine Learning and Formal Syntax as well in the near future.
