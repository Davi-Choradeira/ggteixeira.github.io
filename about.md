## A quick bio

Hello, my name is Guilherme. I'm a web developer, and a linguistics undergraduate student based in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil. 

I love computers and inline skating since the childhood; and I love to read about linguistics and science in general. I like to read science fiction, and fantasy literature too. I also enjoy watching NBA on TV in my spare time.
