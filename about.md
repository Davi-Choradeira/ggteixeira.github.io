## A quick bio

Hello, my name is Guilherme. I'm a Computational Linguistics intern, a developer, and a linguistics undergraduate student based in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil. 

I love computers and inline-skating since the childhood; and I love to read about linguistics and science in general. I love to read science fiction, and fantasy literature too. I also enjoy watching NBA on TV in the spare time.

I'm currently improving my Python and NLP skills in my actual intern job as a computational linguist. I'm also studying JavaScript and Vue.js. My main goal in the college is to develop research on Generative Grammar (a.k.a. Chomskyan Syntax) and Formal Semantics. I hope to know a bit more about Machine Learning as well as Formal Syntax in the near future.
